# Library System (Olibrary)

## Source Code Version

**Description**:
- The application will act as a library's system which can keep track of books from a 
    Book class (containing the name, genre, and initially empty rating of the book)
    and lend them out for a set amount of time before the book is due to return. The app will also
    ask for a rating once a book is returned and store that in the Book then re-add the book into the Library.
    The library will also separate the books by genre allowing duplicate books. 
    *The application will not connect to a library or any website and books will manually have to be added 
    or generated using the Book class*.
